# Key Features:
## Data Preprocessing:
- Initial steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to understand crime trends and patterns.
## Model Development:
- implement Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms for burglary prediction.
- identify the most suitable model for predicting burglary incidents accurately and gain valuable insights into crime hotspots in Los Angeles.including model selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning.
## Evaluation and Insights:
- Detailed analysis of model performance and insights into crime trends, contributing factors, and potential strategies for crime reduction
# How it works:
-  Data Collection:collected data from :https://data.gov/](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present
-  Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, including fill in null values , recode catorgorical or numerical feautures, one-hot encoding, imputation of missing values, and feature engineering.
-  Model Training:Utilize Logistic Regression, Decision Treen and Random Forest to train the data
-  Hyperparameter Optimization: Leveraging the RandomizedSearchCV approach, we meticulously explore a wide range of hyperparameters to identify the optimal settings that enhance the accuracy of predictions.
# Model Evaluation:
- assess the efficacy of three models through a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including the Optimal ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, Recall, and Accuracy Score. 
# Insights Generation: 
- Analyze feature importance to understand the key factors influencing enrollment predictions.
